# How to release

- Edit the `package.json` file and increment the `version` of the package, for example `1.0.0`
- Create and publish a new tag with the same version number as the one in the `package.json` file, with a `v` prefix, for example `v1.0.0`
- Create a new release on Github, document your changes, and name it for example `Release 1.0.0`

## CSS files

When a new `version` is pushed on the `main` branch, there is no automatic release of the CSS files at the moment. You need to release them manually on the github repository.

# Run visual regression testing

```bash
# run Chromatic
$ git checkout main
$ npm run test
```

This will run the test and provide an URL pointing to the Chromatic app. You can learn more about the Chromatic tool at [Chromatic's website.](https://www.chromatic.com/)

If you want to run the test before merging your branches into the `main` branch, you can first check out `stage`, merge your modifications onto this branch, and then run the regression visual test.
