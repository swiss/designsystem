        That's actually a pretty difficult one. I'd probably say a basic answer,
        like Ping-Pong or something like that, but I think that the first game
        that I ever played was Super Mario Brothers. The first one, yes.

        Not the computer, but with the Super Nintendo, the first one. Yes, I
        think a lot of people had that. We didn't have it for a very long time
        and the first time that I ever played it was at a friend's place who was
        the first who had a gaming console of any kind. My dad did have a
        Commodore back in the day, but he used it mostly for his work and not
        for-- He didn't have any games on it, except for Ping-Pong, but I never
        played it, so I would definitely have to go with Super Mario Brothers.

        I would probably have to say from the Fallout series, I would probably
        have to say Fallout 3 because it was the first larger game that I ever
        played and the experience of playing it was just so immersive and
        everything seemed endless, like endless opportunities. So I would
        definitely go with that one.

        That could be debated, but, to a certain extent, yes, yes I do, but very

        addictive.

        Other aspects of life take control much, much more than what video games

        Well, there's [sic] been studies about that. That children who play

        focused really quickly and, well, they react to situations a lot faster
        than those that don't do that.

        Well, I believe that they definitely develop the motorical skills a lot

        more. I feel that my development in languages, for example, has gotten
        considerable through video games, definitely and that my motorical
        skills have definitely developed to a more sensitive side through video
        games because video games create an environment where you have to

        No, no, definitely not. I think that, of course, some are because they

        through their video game playing, but I don't think that's something
        that should be “stereotypicised”. That, you shouldn't stereotype people
        through that. I know some very, very social people who play video games
        and through my own experiences I can't say that out of anyone.

        Yes, yes, I believe that, for example, out of that franchise they made
        one good one and then it was an incredible slippery slope down after
        that. So I would definitely have to say no. I think that they should
        listen to the people who play the video games more when they make them
        and just not, when like a B-quality studio make them and just put more
        focus into it actually being like the game on some levels and not being
        like a stereotypical action movie, which very, very often is.

        True. Okay, so what do you think the video games will be like in the
        future?

        Good question. I think that video games will just be more interactive
        and more immersing, that you will have to do a lot more in physical and
        mental senses in all ways. That's a really diverse topic, but I just
        believe that they will just definitely take you in a lot more than they
        have before, which, I believe, is a good thing. As a gamer. Definitely.
