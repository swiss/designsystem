        That's actually a pretty difficult one. I'd probably say a basic answer, like Ping-Pong or something like that, but I think that the first game that I ever played was Super Mario Brothers. The first one, yes.

        Not the computer, but with the Super Nintendo, the first one. Yes, I think a lot of people had that. We didn't have it for a very long time and the first time that I ever played it was at a friend's place who was the first who had a gaming console of any kind. My dad did have a Commodore back in the day, but he used it mostly for his work and not for-- He didn't have any games on it, except for Ping-Pong, but I never played it, so I would definitely have to go with Super Mario Brothers.

        I would probably have to say from the Fallout series, I would probably have to say Fallout 3 because it was the first larger game that I ever played and the experience of playing it was just so immersive and everything seemed endless, like endless opportunities.

        I would definitely say that yes, yes, they do and I don't think it should be classified like that. I believe that a lot of people could definitely benefit from what video games have to offer and how they can affect your life as in a way of spending your time and, to a certain extent, I believe that video games can lead to social events. Contrary to how people feel about other people who play video games.

        That could be debated, but, to a certain extent, yes, yes I do, but very mildly addictive or not at all. To a person that doesn't have much in their life, definitely a lot of things can be, very simple things can be addictive.

        Well, I believe that they definitely develop the motorical skills a lot and very well and I think that they should be used in teaching a lot more. I feel that my development in languages, for example, has gotten considerable through video games, definitely and that my motorical skills have definitely developed to a more sensitive side through video games because video games create an environment where you have to succeed, you have to respond to situations very quickly. For example, just as an example.

        No, no, definitely not. I think that, of course, some are because they feel that they might play a video game online or they might socialise through their video game playing, but I don't think that's something that should be “stereotypicised”. That, you shouldn't stereotype people through that. I know some very, very social people who play video games and through my own experiences I can't say that out of anyone.

        Yes, yes, I believe that, for example, out of that franchise they made one good one and then it was an incredible slippery slope down after that. So I would definitely have to say no. I think that they should listen to the people who play the video games more when they make them and just not, when like a B-quality studio make them and just put more focus into it actually being like the game on some levels and not being like a stereotypical action movie, which very, very often is.

        True. Okay, so what do you think the video games will be like in the future?

        Good question. I think that video games will just be more interactive and more immersing, that you will have to do a lot more in physical and mental senses in all ways. That's a really diverse topic, but I just believe that they will just definitely take you in a lot more than they have before, which, I believe, is a good thing. As a gamer. Definitely.
