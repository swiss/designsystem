# Authors

## Example

If most of the authors have a picture, we display their images.
When only a few images are missing, they are replaced by the initials of the authors.
If no initials are provided, the disc contains the `User` svg icon.

The default author component include horizontal lines and padding. Use the `bare` prop to remove these properties.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={AuthorsStories.Example} />
</Canvas>

<Controls />

## Example without images

Author images are not displayed in two cases

* When none of the authors or most of them don't have an image
* When author list is very large (more than 7)

<Canvas>
  <Story of={AuthorsStories.ExampleWOPictures} />
</Canvas>
