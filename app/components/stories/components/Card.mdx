## Example

<Canvas of={CardStories.Example} />

<Controls of={CardStories.Example} />

# Variations

## Default card

Use this card for news, pages or articles teasers. Display them in a grid or carousels. With the `card--default` display, an image is mandatory.

More infos about card layouts can be found in the [Cards and Grids](?path=/docs/components-card-cards-and-grids--one-card) section.

Additional information can be included, like meta informations above the title, content specifications after the description, or categories at the bottom of the card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.DefaultCard} />

## Univeral card

With the `card--universal` display, using an image is not mandatory. This layout resolves the problem of having a card without image right after a card with an image.

<Canvas of={CardStories.UniversalCard} />

## Social card

Social Cards are used to display social media posts. They have a distinct header where the logo of the social media platform is displayed. More information can be found in the [Socials section](?path=/docs/sections-content-socials--example-with-1-card) component.

<Canvas of={CardStories.SocialCard} />
