# Variations

## Default card

Use this card for news, pages or articles teasers. Display them in a grid or carousels. With the `card--default` display, an image is mandatory.

More infos about card layouts can be found in the [Cards and Grids](?path=/docs/components-card-cards-and-grids--one-card) section.

Additional information can be included, like meta informations above the title, content specifications after the description, or categories at the bottom of the card.

{/* TODO: check if these background colors are still necessary */}

<Canvas
  style={{ backgroundColor: '#f9fafb', padding: '3rem' }}
  of={CardStories.DefaultCard}
/>

## Univeral card

With the `card--universal` display, using an image is not mandatory. This layout resolves the problem of having a card without image right after a card with an image.

<Canvas
  style={{ backgroundColor: '#f9fafb', padding: '3rem' }}
  of={CardStories.UniversalCard}
/>

## Social card

Social Cards are used to display social media posts. They have a distinct header where the logo of the social media platform is displayed. More information can be found in the [Socials section](?path=/docs/sections-content-socials--example-with-1-card) component.

<Canvas
  style={{ backgroundColor: '#f9fafb', padding: '3rem' }}
  of={CardStories.SocialCard}
/>
