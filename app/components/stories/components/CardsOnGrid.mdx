# Cards and Grids

Most of the time, cards are grouped into a section. They are considered as teasers and they point to a specific content deeper in the website.

# Dynamic list of cards

A news list is a classic example of dynamic list: the content is updated everytime a news is published. The layout is simple and uniform: all columns have the same width.

## Number of cards

**Put a maximum of 3 cards per dynamic list of cards.**

**Exceptions:**

- On a hub page, you have to list every sub pages.
- If you really need to display more items, use the [carousel pattern](?path=/docs/components-carousel--with-bullets).

## Grid classes

For dynamic lists, all columns have the same width. Use one of the following grid variants:

- `grid grid--responsive-cols-2 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--responsive-cols-3 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--responsive-cols-4 gap--responsive`

Below a simplified example of a section with 3 news picked dynamically, and a link pointing to additional content:

<Canvas of={CardsOnGridStories.DynamicList} />

# Curated list of cards

Curated list is a section where the items are picked manually. Depending on the numbers of cards, the layout adapts accordingly.

## Number of rows

**Put a maximum of 5 cards per curated list of cards.**

## Grid classes

For curated lists, columns have different widths depending the numbers of cards. Use one of the following grid variants:

- `grid grid--items-1 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--items-2 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--items-3 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--items-4 gap--responsive` or
- `grid grid--items-5 gap--responsive`

Below a simplified example of a section with 5 cards picked manually, and a link pointing to additional content:
