# Carousel

They are used to display a collection of complex items (teasers or cards for example). This component is similar to the `Slideshow` component, but with a difference on large screens: several items are visible at same time.
Carousels are built with https://swiperjs.com/.

## Bullets as pagination

If the number of images is relatively low (below 6), use the `bullets` variant.

<Canvas of={CarouselStories.WithBullets} />

## Large number of Cards

If the number of cards is larger than 6, the bullet points are hidden through CSS on small viewports.

<Canvas of={CarouselStories.LargeNumberOfCards} />

# Backgrounds

The recommended background colors for carousels are the following: `bg--default`, `bg--accent-01`, `bg--accent-02`, `bg--accent-03`, `bg--accent-04`.

<Canvas of={CarouselStories.Backgrounds} />
