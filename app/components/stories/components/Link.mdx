# Links

## Default links

Per default, `<a>` links are not styled and shouldn't be used unstyled.

<Canvas of={LinkStories.DefaultLink} />

## Links in paragraphs

Links included in paragraphs in the main section (`main p a`) are styled though:

<Canvas of={LinkStories.ParagraphLink} />

## Force Link appearance

You can add a `.link` class to force the link appearance

<Canvas of={LinkStories.ForceLink} />

## Links with icons

Use the `.btn btn--link` component and its variants to display a link with an icon.

**Important:** In this case, the additional icon for external links will be ignored.

# External links

## Links in new windows (target="\_blank")

**Generally, it is recommanded not to use links with `target="_blank"`**

- See argumentations on [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/new-browser-windows-and-tabs/) and [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/use-target_blank/)
- The main justified case for opening links in new windows is to avoid the user losing data (work, playing media, form data, etc) in the current window.

## Icon for external text-links

**The use of the external icon is justified in the following cases:**

- the user goes to an other subdmain (xx.admin.ch -> yy.admin.ch)
- the user completely leaves your domain (xx.admin.ch -> example.com)

**To display the external icon, you have the following possibilities:**

- `<a href="..." rel="external"> Link <a>` (sementical way)
- `<a href="..." class="link--external"> Link </a>` (forced way)

<Canvas of={LinkStories.IconExternalLink} />

## Icon for external cards

**The same rules apply for interactive cards as for text-links**
You'll find a demo of a card with `ExternalLink` in `footerAction` [on the card documentation](?path=/docs/components-card--example).
