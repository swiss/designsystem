# Modal

The `Modal` component allows to display content on top of the page, in an overlay.

See the `Share links` as example of Modal content on the [detail page simple](?path=/docs/pages-detail-page-simple--example).

## Example

<Canvas of={ModalStories.Example} />

<Controls of={ModalStories.Example} />

## Options

**triggerElements**: a string containing all the selectors (classes and id's) which should trigger an opening of the modal.

**layout**: options to control the width of the modal overlay:

* `undefined`: the modal will have the same width as the website container.
* `auto`: the width of the modal depends on the width of the `body` content. Max-width is the website's container width.
* `xs`: the modal will have a max-width of `480px`.
* `sm`: the modal will have a max-width of `640px`.
* `md`: the modal will have a max-width of `768px`.
* `lg`: the modal will have a max-width of `1024px`.
* `xl`: the modal will have a max-width of `1280px`.

**title**: a title placed on top of the modal.

**footer**: a slot to place call to actions at the end of the modal, beeing always visible, also when the body is too loog for the viewport.

## Accessibility

* The modal components should always be placed after the `main` tag.
* When several modals are present on a page, they should have an `uuid`, for accessibility purpose. (unique `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` )
* The `title`should always be delivered.
