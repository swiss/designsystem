# MultiSelect

## General

- A multi select component is complex to style and customize without using a library. In this style guide, we use [Vue Select](https://vue-select.org/) to handle the logic and style of the select. Vue 2 and 3 are supported. To avoid a pollution of the CSS with Vue-only styles for other frameworks, all CSS definitions are scoped to the demo Vue component.

- The `MultiSelect` component is a wrapper around the `Vue Select` component.

- If you define the `multiple` prop to false, you can use this component instead of the standard `Select` component.

## Example

<Canvas of={MultiSelectStories.Example} />

<Controls of={MultiSelectStories.Example} />

## Install Vue Select

```bash
npm install vue-select@beta
```

## Overwrite Vue Select child components

The `Deselect` button and the `Openindicator` are two child components of the `Vue Select` component. You can overwrite them to match the style guide with the help of the following props:

```html
<vSelect :components="{Deselect, OpenIndicator}" ... />
```

and render directly the child components in the `data` function:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
  import { h } from 'vue'
  const Deselect = { render: () => h('span', 'Ã—') }
  const OpenIndicator = { render: () => h('span') } // replace the default icon
</script>
```
