# Slideshow

Slideshows are used to display a collection of images. This component is similar to the `Carousel` component, but with a difference on large screens: only one item is visible at same time.
Slideshows are built with https://swiperjs.com/. Check the documentation for specific topics, like lazy loading if you have a large list of pictures.

## Bullets as pagination

If the number of images is relatively low (around 5), use the `bullets` variant.

<Canvas of={SlideshowStories.WithBullets} />

## Fraction as pagination

If the number of images is higher than 5, it's better to use the `fraction` variant.

<Canvas of={SlideshowStories.WithFraction} />
