# Tabs

Tabs are used to group related content. They can also be used to switch between views. On normal detail pages, prefer accordeons to tabs to avoid overflowing tabs.

If you want to add vertical spacing to the content of your tab, add the class `.vertical-spacing` to the `.tab__container` element. [More information about vertical spacings](?path=/docs/layouts-spacings--page).

# Overflowing Tabs

While it is not advised to use more than 4 tabs, it can happen that the tabs are too large or too many to fit in the available space. In this case, the tabcontainer can be made to overflow.

If the tabs are placed in a grey container (`.bg--accent-01`), the colors will update accordingly.
