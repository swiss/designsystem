# TagItem

## Example

TagItems are similar to [badges](?path=/docs/components-badge--example), but they are bigger and interactive. They ensure to have the recommended minimal height of 44px for clickability.

<Controls of={TagItemStories.Example} />

## List

Wrap TagItems into `ul.list--flex.list--wrap li` to display them as an horizontal list.
You can add a `hr.separator` element on top to separate the list from the rest of the content.

## Filters

A list of TagItems can be used as a filter feature.
Attribute a `.tag-item--active` class to the selected element.
A `button` element is recommended in place of a `a` link.
