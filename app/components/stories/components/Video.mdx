# Video embed

To make an embed video responsive and keep its ratio, wrap it with a `ratio ratio--[variant]` class.
If the video need a label, use the `figure` and `figcaption`combination.

```html
<figure>
  <div class="ratio ratio--16/9">
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"
      src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vIG4cKz7ukM"
      title="YouTube video player"
      frameborder="0"
      allowfullscreen
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Video label — © Author Name</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Wrapped into a `ratio` parent, the `iframe` element becomes responsive and keeps a specific ratio. Thus, the video width is defined by the `container` parent, and the video height is defined by the `ratio--[variant]` class. The `width` and the `height` attributes of the `iframe` element have no effect anymore.
