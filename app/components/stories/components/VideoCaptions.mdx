# Video captions

If you host the video yourself and you have a `.vtt` file to describe the video captions, use the `track` element to add them. More informations about the [Video Text Track format](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) and [customisation examples](https://css-tricks.com/improving-video-accessibility-with-webvtt/)

```html
<video controls src="path/to/your/video.mp4">
  <track default kind="captions" srclang="en" src="path/to/your/file.vtt" />
</video>
```

## Example

Play the video above to see the video captions and the improved styles for accessibility. You can also play the video in fullscreen to see the adapted styles.
