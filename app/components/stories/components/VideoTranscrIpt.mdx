# Video transcript

A transcript is a list of all the words that are spoken in the video. If you host the video yourself and you have a related transcript, this additional content is added below the video player in an `Accordion` component. The transcript is not a replacement for captions, but it can be used to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing understand the video.
