## Hero for detail pages, with only a title and subtitle

This variant can contain only a title and subtitle.

<Canvas of={HeroStories.DetailPageTitleOnly} />

## Hero for screenreaders only

If there isn't any specific content for the hero, we still need to display a `h1` title for screen readers.
Set type to `sr-only` to hide the component visually. Check the <a href="?path=/story/sections-content-hero--example">Storybook Canvas Tab</a> to display the HTML markup.

<Canvas of={HeroStories.ScreenReadersOnly} />

<a href="?path=/story/sections-content-hero--example">
  {'Go to the Canvas Tab'}
</a>
